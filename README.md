# Crowd Size Detection - Case Study

## Aim:
In this case study, we explore the task of crowd size detection using a machine learning approach. The primary goal is to train a model to predict the number of people present in an image at a particular place. The dataset comprises images, each labeled with the corresponding crowd size.

## Abstract:
Estimating the size of a crowd is important, in different areas such as event planning, public safety and urban development. In this case study, we introduce a method for estimating or counting crowd size using ridge regression model. This method addresses a few problems that might occur in model, such as multicollinearity and overfitting. When working with complex datasets, such as those used in crowd monitoring, these issues become much more important. It also provides a method for dealing with the noise and anomalies that are frequently seen in scenarios involving crowd surveillance. Ridge regression is the method being proposed to develop a forecasting model that takes into account input data in order to anticipate crowd sizes. The recommended approach's primary elements include acquiring information, extracting features, training a model with ridge regression, and calculating the crowd size. The proposed method opens up new research avenues for refining and adjusting ridge regression-based models for specific scenarios and requirements pertaining to crowd surveillance. Because of this, there are now more opportunities for research and development, which will aid in refining and tailoring the strategy to the specifics of varied crowd-related scenarios.

## Steps Performed in the Case Study

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration:
- Load image data and labels from the provided dataset.
- Explore and visualize random images along with their associated crowd size labels.

### 2. Image Preprocessing:
- Convert original images to thermal images using a color map.
- Analyze and compare the histogram distributions of pixel values for both original and thermal images.
- Resize images to a manageable size (50x50) to reduce the number of features.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation:
- Implement Ridge regression to predict crowd sizes.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
- Save the trained model for future use.

### 4. Predicting a New Image:
- Predict crowd sizes for a new image.
- Load a new image, preprocess it, and make predictions using the trained model.
- Print the predicted number of people in the new image.

## Used:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- opencv-python
- Pillow

## Conclusion:
Results underscores the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques for crowd size detection in images. By preprocessing images and training a Ridge regression model, we achieved promising results in predicting the number of people present. The model's performance was evaluated on both training and testing datasets, showing good accuracy in predicting crowd sizes. Additionally, we successfully applied the trained model to predict crowd sizes in new images. This study highlights the potential of machine learning in practical applications such as crowd monitoring and management
